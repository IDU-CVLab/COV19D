# COV19D
The project includes working on a chest CT-scan series of images and masks in order to develop an automated classification algorithm for Covid-19/non-Covid-19 diagnosis. The project is towards the international COV19D cmmpetetion described in section B at https://mlearn.lincoln.ac.uk/mia-cov19d/.
# The codes
The codes try to work on either homogenious model or hybrid models:
1. Homogenious Models: Trying a simple CNN model consisting of five convolusion layers. The code '3D_Image_Classification.ipynb' reaches macro f1 score 0.7003 on the training set and 0.6965 on the validation set.
2. Hybrid Models:
